# Wire Transfer Changes
## Important Information Regarding Wire Transfers
### Effective June 1, 2024, TexasBank will implement new procedures for initiating wire transfers to enhance security and streamline the process for our valued customers.
**Key Changes:**
  * **In-Person Wires:** All wire transfers initiated in person at a TexasBank branch will require the customer to complete and sign a new Wire Transfer Request Form. This form will replace previous methods and ensure all necessary information is captured accurately and securely.
  * **Digital Banking Wires:** For customers utilizing our Digital Banking platform, wire transfers will now be initiated exclusively through the secure online portal. This change provides a more efficient and secure way to manage your transfers from anywhere.
  * **Verbal Wire Requests:** To further protect our customers from fraud, TexasBank will no longer accept verbal requests for wire transfers, whether over the phone or in person. All wire transfer requests must be submitted either in person with the new form or through Digital Banking.
### What You Need to Do:
  * **For In-Person Wires:** Please visit your nearest TexasBank branch to obtain and complete the new Wire Transfer Request Form. Our branch staff will be happy to assist you with any questions and guide you through the process.
  * **For Digital Banking Wires:** If you are not yet enrolled in Digital Banking, we encourage you to do so to take advantage of this convenient and secure method. Our customer service team can assist you with enrollment and provide guidance on initiating wire transfers online.
We understand that changes to banking procedures can sometimes be inconvenient, but these measures are essential to safeguard your funds and provide you with the highest level of security. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we implement these important updates.
If you have any questions or require assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our customer service team at 833.987.2265 or visit your local TexasBank branch.

### Benefits of Overdraft Privilege

*   Safeguards your credit score from negative impacts due to missed payments or insufficient funds.
*   Ensures smooth transactions like bill payments and purchases even with a temporarily low account balance.
*   Offers flexibility for necessary transactions, avoiding declined payments and simplifying financial management.
*   Provides emergency support during financial challenges, acting as a safety net for temporary setbacks.

*   Enroll in overdraft protection today to protect your checking account and maintain financial peace of mind.

### What You Need to Know about ATM/Debit Card Overdraft Services

An overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money in your account to cover a transaction, but TexasBank pays it anyway.

*   **Two Ways to Cover Overdrafts:**
    1.  Standard overdraft practices that come with your account.
    2.  Overdraft protection plans, such as a link to a savings account, which may be less expensive.

### Fees for Overdrafts

Under standard overdraft practices:

*   A fee of up to $25 will be charged each time an overdraft is paid.
*   No more than six fees will be charged per day.
*   No charge for a balance not exceeding negative $10.

### Standard Overdraft Practices

TexasBank *does* authorize and pay overdrafts for:

*   Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number.
*   Automatic bill payments.

TexasBank *will not* authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions unless you ask them to:

*   ATM transactions
*   Everyday debit card transactions

*   **Discretionary Service:** TexasBank pays overdrafts at its discretion and does not guarantee that it will always authorize and pay any type of transaction. If an overdraft is not authorized and paid, your transaction will be declined.

### Opt-in for ATM and Everyday Debit Card Overdrafts

If you want TexasBank to authorize and pay overdrafts on ATM and everyday debit card transactions, you can:

*   Call 800.281.3889
*   Submit the Opt In/Opt Out form
*   Visit any TexasBank location

### Overdraft/Returned Item Fees

*   **Overdraft Fee:** $25.00 per item paid against a non-sufficient funds balance.
*   **Returned Item Fee:** $25.00 per item returned unpaid that was presented against a non-sufficient funds balance.

The fee applies to overdrafts created by check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal, or other electronic means. A non-sufficient funds balance may result from:
A) The payment of checks, electronic funds transfers, or other withdrawal requests;
B) Payments authorized by you;
C) The return, unpaid, of items deposited by you;
D) The imposition of bank service charges; or
E) The deposit of items which, according to the bank's Funds Availability Policy, are treated as not yet "available" or finally paid.

TexasBank may refuse to pay an overdraft at any time, even if your account is in good standing or if previous overdrafts were paid. You will be notified by mail of any non-sufficient funds items paid or returned, though there is no obligation to notify you before paying or returning an item. The amount of any overdrafts plus fees is due and payable upon demand.

### Limitations

*   Available only to eligible checking accounts. (Money Market and Savings accounts, Minor accounts, and Public Fund accounts are not eligible).
*   TexasBank may limit the number of accounts eligible for the Overdraft Privilege service to one account per household.
*   If you wish to decline the Overdraft Privilege service, call the bank at (800) 281-3889 and request the overdraft limit be removed.
*   Returned Item/Overdraft (OD) fees will be limited to six (6) per day.
*   No Returned Item/Overdraft fee will be imposed if your balance does not fall below a $10.00 overdraft (negative) balance.

*The Overdraft Privilege service does not constitute an actual or implied agreement between you and the bank, nor an actual or implied obligation of or by the bank. This service represents a purely discretionary courtesy or privilege that the bank may provide from time to time and which may be withdrawn or withheld at any time without prior notice or reason or cause.*

*$300-$500.00 Overdraft Privilege - $25.00 Fee for each item paid in overdraft.*
*(A Discretionary Overdraft Service) - It is the policy of our Bank to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and to conduct business in accordance with applicable safety and soundness standards.*

## Security Information

TexasBank is committed to the security of your personal information. Follow these tips to help keep your identity and accounts secure:

*   **Use strong and unique passwords:** Use complex passwords with significant length for all accounts. Use a unique password for each account to prevent additional compromise if one account is breached.
*   **Implement multi-factor authentication:** TexasBank offers multi-factor authentication to add a second layer of security. Ensure your online banking and other personal accounts use MFA (e.g., confirmation text, email, or app authentication code).
*   **Think before you click:** Over 90% of successful cyber-attacks start with phishing emails. Be suspicious of emails that appear legitimate but aim to trick you into revealing personal information or running malicious software. Trust your instincts.
*   **Keep your devices and software updated:** Manufacturers and software providers publish updates to combat exploits. Turn on automatic updates, keep all devices updated, do not modify device settings from factory defaults, and only install applications from trusted sources.
*   **Check your privacy and security settings:** Regularly review privacy and security settings to control your online presence and limit shared information.
*   **Monitor activity:** Examine account statements to identify and report any unauthorized transactions. If found, change account passwords and request new account information. Federal law entitles you to a free credit report every 12 months (www.AnnualCreditReport.com).
*   **Card and ATM Precautions:**
    *   Treat your card like cash and keep your PIN secret.
    *   Contact TexasBank immediately if your card is lost or stolen.
    *   Observe the area before approaching an ATM.
    *   Avoid opening your purse, bag, or wallet while waiting; have your card ready.
    *   At drive-up ATMs, keep your engine running, doors locked, and windows up. Leave enough room to exit quickly if needed.
    *   If followed after an ATM transaction, go to a crowded, well-lit area and call the police.
