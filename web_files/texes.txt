### Overdraft Privilege
Once qualified:  
  * Overdraft protection prevents costly fees by covering shortfall in account funds, saving you money.
  * It safeguards your credit score from negative impacts due to missed payments or insufficient funds.
  * Ensures smooth transactions like bill payments and purchases even with a temporarily low account balance.
  * Offers flexibility for necessary transactions, avoiding declined payments and simplifying financial management.
  * Provides emergency support during financial challenges, acting as a safety net for temporary setbacks.
Ensure financial stability and avoid unnecessary stress by enrolling in overdraft protection today to protect your checking account and maintain financial peace of mind.
**Personal Checking** Manage your money with confidence and freedom.
Overdraft Privilege FAQs
**What You Need to Know about ATM/Debit Card Overdraft Services**  
An overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money in your account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway. We can cover your overdrafts in two different ways:
  * We have standard overdraft practices that come with your account.  
  * We also offer overdraft protection plans, such as a link to a savings account, which may be less expensive than our standard overdraft practices. To learn more, ask us about these plans.  
**What fees will I be charged if TexasBank pays my overdraft?**  
Under our standard overdraft practices:
  * We will charge you a fee of up to $25 each time we pay an overdraft.  
  * We will charge no more than six fees per day and there is no charge for a balance not exceeding negative $10.  
**What are the standard overdraft practices that come with my account?**  
We do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions:
  * Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number  
  * Automatic bill payments  
We will not authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions unless you ask us to:
  * ATM transactions  
  * Everyday debit card transactions  
We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize and pay any type of transaction. If we do not authorize and pay an overdraft, your transaction will be declined.
**What if l want TexasBank to authorize and pay overdrafts on my ATM and everyday debit card transactions?**
If you want us to authorize and pay overdrafts on ATM and everyday debit card transactions, call 800.281.3889, submit the Opt In/Opt Out form, or visit any of our locations.
**Overdraft/Returned Item Fee**
  * Overdraft Fee: $25.00 per item paid against a non-sufficient funds balance.
  * Returned Item Fee: $25.00 per item returned unpaid that was presented against a non-sufficient funds balance.
The fee applies to overdrafts created by check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal, or other electronic means. A non-sufficient funds balance may result from: A) The payment of checks, electronic funds transfers, or other withdrawal requests; B) Payments authorized by you; C) The return, unpaid, of items deposited by you; D) The imposition of bank service charges; or E) The deposit of items which according to the bank's Funds Availability Policy, are treated as not yet "available" or finally p...
We may refuse to pay an overdraft for you at any time, even though your account is in good standing and even though we may have previously paid overdrafts for you. You will be notified by mail of any non-sufficient funds items paid or returned that you may have; however, we have no obligation to notify you before we pay or return any item. The amount of any overdrafts plus our Returned Item and/or Overdraft Fee(s) that you owe us shall be due and payable upon demand. If there is an overdraft pai...
**LIMITATIONS:** Available only to eligible checking accounts. (Money Market and Savings accounts, Minor accounts, and Public Fund accounts are not eligible) We may limit the number of accounts eligible for the Overdraft Privilege *service to one account per household.
If you wish to decline the Overdraft Privilege* service, simply call the bank at (800) 281-3889 and request the overdraft limit be removed from your account.
Returned Item/Overdraft (OD) fees will be limited to six (6) per day.
No Returned Item/Overdraft fee will be imposed if your balance does not fall below a $10.00 overdraft (negative) balance.  
_*The Overdraft Privilege service does not constitute an actual or implied agreement between you and the bank. Nor does it constitute an actual or implied obligation of or by the bank. This service represents a purely discretionary courtesy or privilege that the bank may provide to you from time to time and which may be withdrawn or withheld by the bank at any time without prior notice or reason or cause._
_$300-$500.00 Overdraft Privilege - $25.00 Fee for each item paid in overdraft._  
_(A Discretionary Overdraft Service) -__It is the policy of our Bank to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and to conduct business in accordance with applicable safety and soundness standards._

# Security Information
TexasBank remains committed to the security of your personal information. Use the following tips to help keep your identity and accounts secure: 
**Use strong and unique passwords:**
Strong passwords, including complex passwords with significant length, should be used across all accounts. Use a unique password for each account to prevent additional compromise should a single account be compromised. 
**Implement multi-factor authentication on your accounts:**
TexasBank offers multi-factor authentication to add a second layer of authentication to help prevent your accounts from compromise. Ensure that your online banking accounts, and all other personal accounts, utilize multi-factor authentication, such as a confirmation text message, email, or app authentication code. 
**Think before you click:**
More than 90% of successful cyber-attacks start with a phishing email. Phishing emails may include a spoofed link or webpage that may appear to be legitimate but is used to trick you to reveal your passwords or personal information or run malicious software. If you receive an email that is suspicious, trust your instincts and think before you click or provide sensitive information. 
**Keep your devices and software updated:**
Bad actors exploit flaws in software to gain access to your devices and accounts. To combat this threat, manufacturers and software providers publish updates to help prevent this exploitation. Turn on automatic updates and ensure that all your devices stay up-to-date with software, do not modify your device settings or deviate from factory settings, and only install applications and software from trusted sources. 
**Check your privacy and security settings:**
Regularly check privacy and security settings to ensure that your online presence is limited or controlled to an appropriate level to ensure that you don’t share too much information online. 
**Monitor activity:**
Examine account statements to identify and report any unauthorized transactions. If unauthorized transactions are found, consider changing account passwords and request new account information. 
Federal law entitles you to a free copy of your credit report every 12 months. Visit www.AnnualCreditReport.com to request your free copy or monitor your credit through a number of credit monitoring services. 
**Card and ATM Precautions:**
Treat your card like cash and keep your PIN number a secret. Should your card be lost or stolen, contact TexasBank immediately. When using an ATM: 
  * Observe the entire area before approaching the ATM. 
  * Avoid opening your purse, bag, or wallet while waiting for the ATM. Have your card out before you approach the ATM. 
  * Keep your engine running, doors locked and windows up when waiting in line at a drive-up ATM. Leave enough room between cars to allow for a quick exit should it become necessary. 
  * If anyone follows you after making an ATM transaction, go immediately to a crowded, well-lit area and call the police.
