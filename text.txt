Following its resounding debut in 2024, The Oberoi Concours d’Elegance returns for its 2nd edition at The Oberoi
Udaivilas, Udaipur from 20th to 22nd February 2026. This world-class celebration of automotive heritage,
craftsmanship, and luxury brings together an extraordinary global assemblage of classic automobiles and
motorcycles dating from the early 1900s.

Upcoming Edition: February 2026

The Oberoi Concours d'Elegance 2026 will begin with The Oberoi Tour d’Elegance, an exclusive drive
showcasing all vehicle entries in a magnificent cavalcade around the picturesque Fateh Sagar Lake, Udaipur. This
spectacular prelude will be a fitting start to a weekend of timeless elegance and prestige in the City of Lakes.

Founded in Tradition

Over its 90 year history, Oberoi Hotels & Resorts’ commitment to excellence and preserving Indian heritage has

promises to build on this legacy, offering an unparalleled experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of The
Oberoi Udaivilas, Udaipur.

Set against the majestic backdrop of the City Palace and Lake Pichola, the traditional domed architecture of The
Oberoi Udaivilas, Udaipur offers a magical setting for showcasing remarkable motoring design and craftsmanship.
India’s history with motorcars began in the 1890s. Through the patronage of Indian royalty and private collectors,
an automotive legacy flourished, encompassing some of the rarest and most significant automobiles in history.
The Oberoi Concours d’Elegance celebrates elegance, innovation and heritage.

View Venue
The Stay

Ever since The Oberoi Udaivilas first opened it doors to guests in 2002, it has been recognised the world over for
its impeccable hospitality and authentic experiences. From spacious rooms and suites with private pools, to fine
dining with lake and garden views, personalised wellness offerings and an unobtrusive attention to guests’ needs
that is distinctly Oberoi. When you stay at The Oberoi Udaivilas, you travel across the lake and step into a golden
age you may never want to leave.

The Dharma/Philosophy

Everything about Oberoi Hotels & Resorts is founded on the belief that the guest is everything. This philosophy is
evident in its people and manifested most visibly in the sincere personal care we provide for every guest. While it
is true that Oberoi's exceptional properties, accommodations and facilities contribute greatly to the esteem in
which they are held, they measure their success by the value of the human interaction practiced by their people
and deeply felt by their guests. This is because they know that what comes from the heart is felt in the heart.
Heart. Felt.
